# Health Connect Project

Welcome to the Health Connect project! This project is designed to streamline remote healthcare services through blockchain technology, focusing on Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) for secure and efficient operations. Health Connect offers a range of key features to facilitate seamless communication, appointment management, health record maintenance, event scheduling, and doctor search functionalities.

## Key Features

### 1. Internet Identity Authorization

Health Connect implements Internet Identity Authorization, providing a secure authentication mechanism for users accessing the platform. With Internet Identity, users can authenticate themselves securely, enhancing the overall security and privacy of the system. (This feature is currently not in our code due to the failure of cushing of the laptop that had the whole functioning code. We'll implement it soon.)

### 2. Registration Canisters

Registration Canisters serve as the backbone for user onboarding onto the Health Connect platform. Through registration canisters, users can create accounts securely, gaining access to various features and functionalities provided by Health Connect.

### 3. Appointment Canister

The Appointment Canister is a core component of Health Connect, allowing users to schedule, manage, and track appointments with healthcare providers remotely. Users can browse available appointment slots, book appointments, and receive confirmations instantly, simplifying the appointment scheduling process.

### 4. Health Record Management

Health Connect offers robust health record management capabilities, leveraging blockchain technology for secure storage and retrieval of health records. Users can update, delete, and retrieve their health records seamlessly, ensuring data integrity and privacy throughout the process.
This will be possible whereby a form will be created on the docto'r front end, they fill the health report and attach it with the patient's username. Once it's send to the blockchain, the data is stored on the respective patient's history page.

### 5. Event Creation, Updating, and Deleting

Users have the ability to create, update, and delete events related to their healthcare needs within the Health Connect platform. This feature will enable individuals or organizations to collect data from patient's who will be willing to share to them for data analysis purposes, at a fee in benefit to the patient

## 6. Search field

Health Connect features a comprehensive doctor search functionality, enabling users to find healthcare providers based on various criteria such as specialty, location, availability, and patient reviews. The search feature enhances accessibility and helps users connect with suitable healthcare professionals.

## Note

More features are to be added including connection to crypto wallets to enable payment of services among users.

## Getting Started

To begin using Health Connect, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run npm install
3. Run dfx start
4. Open a separate ternminal and run dfx deploy
5. Click on the front end canister link to start interacting with the canisters.

**Note:**The actual code for this project has not been uploaded due to the crashing of the laptop bearing the final code. However, we've deployed the front end in vercel. The link to it is https://doctor-patient-application-7edw.vercel.app/ . 
To land on patient's user page, use this link https://doctor-patient-application-7edw.vercel.app/home.html .
To access the doctor's page, use this link https://doctor-patient-application-7edw.vercel.app/doctor.html .
We apologise for this inconvinience but we hope to fix it as soon as possible
